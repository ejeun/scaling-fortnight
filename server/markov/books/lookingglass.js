export default [`Oh, you wicked little thing!`,
`Really, Dinah ought to have taught you better manners`,
`You OUGHT, Dinah, you know you ought!`,
`Do you know what to morrow is, Kitty?`,
`You'd have guessed if you'd been up in the window with me only Dinah was making you tidy, so you couldn't`,
`I was watching the boys getting in sticks for the bonfire and it wants plenty of sticks, Kitty`,
`Only it got so cold, and it snowed so, they had to leave off`,
`Never mind, Kitty, we'll go and see the bonfire to morrow.`,
`Do you know, I was so angry, Kitty when I saw all the mischief you had been doing, I was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into the snow`,
`And you'd have deserved it, you little mischievous darling`,
`What have you got to say for yourself`,
`Now don't interrupt me!`,
`I'm going to tell you all your faults`,
`Number one: you squeaked twice while Dinah was washing your face this morning`,
`Now you can't deny it, Kitty: I heard you`,
`What's that you say?`,
`Her paw went into your eye`,
`Well, that's YOUR fault, for keeping your eyes open if you'd shut them tight up, it wouldn't have happened`,
`Now don't make any more excuses, but listen`,
`Number two: you pulled Snowdrop away by the tail just as I had put down the saucer of milk before her`,
`What, you were thirsty, were you`,
`How do you know she wasn't thirsty too`,
`Now for number three: you unwound every bit of the worsted while I wasn't looking`,
`That's three faults, Kitty, and you've not been punished for any of them yet`,
`You know I'm saving up all your punishments for Wednesday week Suppose they had saved up all MY punishments!`,
`What WOULD they do at the end of a year`,
`I should be sent to prison, I suppose, when the day came`,
`Or let me see suppose each punishment was to be going without a dinner: then, when the miserable day came, I should have to go without fifty dinners at once`,
`Well, I shouldn't mind THAT much`,
`I'd far rather go without them than eat them`,
`Do you hear the snow against the window panes, Kitty`,
`How nice and soft it sounds`,
`Just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside`,
`I wonder if the snow LOVES the trees and fields, that it kisses them so gently`,
`And then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt`,
`and perhaps it says, `,
`Go to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes again.`,
`And when they wake up in the summer, Kitty, they dress themselves all in green, and dance about whenever the wind blows oh, that's very pretty!`,
`And I do so WISH it was true`,
`I'm sure the woods look sleepy in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown`,
`Kitty, can you play chess`,
`Now, don't smile, my dear, I'm asking it seriously`,
`Because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as if you understood it: and when I said `,
`Check!`,
`you purred`,
`Well, it WAS a nice check, Kitty, and really I might have won, if it hadn't been for that nasty Knight, that came wiggling down among my pieces`,
`Kitty, dear, let's pretend `,
`Let's pretend.`,
`Let's pretend we're kings and queens;`,
`Well, YOU can be one of them then, and I'll be all the rest.`,
`Nurse`,
`Do let's pretend that I'm a hungry hyaena, and you're a bone.`,
`Let's pretend that you're the Red Queen, Kitty`,
`Do you know, I think if you sat up and folded your arms, you'd look exactly like her`,
`Now do try, there's a dear!`,
`and if you're not good directly I'll put you through into Looking glass House`,
`How would you like THAT?`,
`Now, if you'll only attend, Kitty, and not talk so much, I'll tell you all my ideas about Looking glass House`,
`First, there's the room you can see through the glass that's just the same as our drawing room, only the things go the other way`,
`I can see all of it when I get upon a chair all but the bit behind the fireplace`,
`Oh`,
`I do so wish I could see THAT bit`,
`I want so much to know whether they've a fire in the winter: you never CAN tell, you know, unless our fire smokes, and then smoke comes up in that room too but that may be only pretence, just to make it look as if they had a fire`,
`Well then, the books are something like our books, only the words go the wrong way`,
`I know that, because I've held up one of our books to the glass, and then they hold up one in the other room`,
`How would you like to live in Looking glass House, Kitty`,
`I wonder if they'd give you milk in there`,
`Perhaps Looking glass milk isn't good to drink But oh, Kitty`,
`now we come to the passage`,
`You can just see a little PEEP of the passage in Looking glass House, if you leave the door of our drawing room wide open: and it's very like our passage as far as you can see, only you know it may be quite different on beyond`,
`Oh, Kitty`,
`how nice it would be if we could only get through into Looking glass House`,
`I'm sure it's got, oh`,
`such beautiful things in it`,
`Let's pretend there's a way of getting through into it, somehow, Kitty`,
`Let's pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get through`,
`Why, it's turning into a sort of mist now, I declare`,
`It'll be easy enough to get through `,
`So I shall be as warm here as I was in the old room warmer, in fact, because there'll be no one here to scold me away from the fire`,
`Oh, what fun it'll be, when they see me through the glass in here, and can't get at me!`,
`They don't keep this room so tidy as the other Oh!`,
`Here are the Red King and the Red Queen and there are the White King and the White Queen sitting on the edge of the shovel and here are two castles walking arm in arm I don't think they can hear me and I'm nearly sure they can't see me`,
`I feel somehow as if I were invisible `,
`It is the voice of my child!`,
`My precious Lily`,
`My imperial kitten!`,
`Imperial fiddlestick!`,
`Mind the volcano!`,
`What volcano?`,
`Blew me up Mind you come up the regular way don't get blown up!`,
`Why, you'll be hours and hours getting to the table, at that rate`,
`I'd far better help you, hadn't I?`,
`Oh`,
`PLEASE don't make such faces, my dear!`,
`You make me laugh so that I can hardly hold you`,
`And don't keep your mouth so wide open`,
`All the ashes will get into it there, now I think you're tidy enough!`,
`I assure, you my dear, I turned cold to the very ends of my whiskers!`,
`You haven't got any whiskers.`,
`The horror of that moment I shall never, NEVER forget!`,
`You will, though if you don't make a memorandum of it.`,
`My dear`,
`I really MUST get a thinner pencil`,
`I can't manage this one a bit`,
`it writes all manner of things that I don't intend `,
`What manner of things?`,
`THE WHITE KNIGHT IS SLIDING DOWN THE POKER`,
`HE BALANCES VERY BADLY`,
`That's not a memorandum of YOUR feelings!`,
`for it's all in some language I don't know Why, it's a Looking glass book, of course`,
`And if I hold it up to a glass, the words will all go the right way again.`,
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe`,
`All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe`,
`Beware the Jabberwock, my son`,
`The jaws that bite, the claws that catch`,
`Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun The frumious Bandersnatch!`,
`And hast thou slain the Jabberwock`,
`Come to my arms, my beamish boy`,
`O frabjous day`,
`Callooh`,
`Callay!`,
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe`,
`All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe`,
`It seems very pretty but it's RATHER hard to understand!`,
`Somehow it seems to fill my head with ideas only I don't exactly know what they are`,
`However, SOMEBODY killed SOMETHING: that's clear, at any rate `,
`But oh!`,
`if I don't make haste I shall have to go back through the Looking glass, before I've seen what the rest of the house is like`,
`Let's have a look at the garden first!`,
`I should see the garden far better if I could get to the top of that hill: and here's a path that leads straight to it at least, no, it doesn't do that `,
`but I suppose it will at last`,
`But how curiously it twists`,
`It's more like a corkscrew than a path`,
`Well, THIS turn goes to the hill, I suppose no, it doesn't`,
`This goes straight back to the house`,
`Well then, I'll try it the other way.`,
`It's no use talking about it I'm NOT going in again yet`,
`I know I should have to get through the Looking glass again back into the old room and there'd be an end of all my adventures!`,
`I really SHALL do it this time `,
`Oh, it's too bad!`,
`I never saw such a house for getting in the way`,
`Never!`,
`O Tiger lily I WISH you could talk!`,
`We CAN talk when there's anybody worth talking to.`,
`And can ALL the flowers talk?`,
`As well as YOU can And a great deal louder.`,
`It isn't manners for us to begin, you know and I really was wondering when you'd speak`,
`Said I to myself, `,
`Her face has got SOME sense in it, though it's not a clever one!`,
`Still, you're the right colour, and that goes a long way.`,
`I don't care about the colour If only her petals curled up a little more, she'd be all right.`,
`Aren't you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody to take care of you?`,
`There's the tree in the middle what else is it good for?`,
`But what could it do, if any danger came?`,
`It says `,
`Bough wough!`,
`that's why its branches are called boughs!`,
`Didn't you know THAT?`,
`Silence, every one of you!`,
`They know I can't get at them!`,
`or they wouldn't dare to do it!`,
`Never mind!`,
`If you don't hold your tongues, I'll pick you!`,
`That's right!`,
`The daisies are worst of all`,
`When one speaks, they all begin together, and it's enough to make one wither to hear the way they go on!`,
`How is it you can all talk so nicely?`,
`I've been in many gardens before, but none of the flowers could talk.`,
`Put your hand down, and feel the ground Then you'll know why.`,
`It's very hard but I don't see what that has to do with it.`,
`In most gardens they make the beds too soft so that the flowers are always asleep.`,
`I never thought of that before!`,
`It's MY opinion that you never think AT ALL I never saw anybody that looked stupider Hold YOUR tongue!`,
`As if YOU ever saw anybody`,
`You keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know no more what's going on in the world, than if you were a bud!`,
`Are there any more people in the garden besides me?`,
`There's one other flower in the garden that can move about like you I wonder how you do it `,
`You're always wondering but she's more bushy than you are.`,
`Is she like me?`,
`There's another little girl in the garden, somewhere!`,
`Well, she has the same awkward shape as you but she's redder and her petals are shorter, I think.`,
`Her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.`,
`But that's not YOUR fault you're beginning to fade, you know and then one can't help one's petals getting a little untidy.`,
`Does she ever come out here?`,
`I daresay you'll see her soon She's one of the thorny kind.`,
`Where does she wear the thorns?`,
`Why all round her head, of course I was wondering YOU hadn't got some too`,
`I thought it was the regular rule.`,
`She's coming!`,
`I hear her footstep, thump, thump, thump, along the gravel walk!`,
`She's grown a good deal!`,
`It's the fresh air that does it wonderfully fine air it is, out here.`,
`I think I'll go and meet her You can't possibly do that _I_ should advise you to walk the other way.`,
`Where do you come from?`,
`And where are you going`,
`Look up, speak nicely, and don't twiddle your fingers all the time.`,
`I don't know what you mean by YOUR way all the ways about here belong to ME but why did you come out here at all?`,
`Curtsey while you're thinking what to say, it saves time.`,
`I'll try it when I go home the next time I'm a little late for dinner.`,
`It's time for you to answer now open your mouth a LITTLE wider when you speak, and always say `,
`your Majesty.`,
`I only wanted to see what the garden was like, your Majesty `,
`That's right though, when you say `,
`garden,`,
`I'vE seen gardens, compared with which this would be a wilderness.`,
`and I thought I'd try and find my way to the top of that hill `,
`When you say `,
`hill,`,
`_I_ could show you hills, in comparison with which you'd call that a valley.`,
`No, I shouldn't a hill CAN't be a valley, you know`,
`That would be nonsense `,
`You may call it `,
`nonsense`,
`if you like but I'vE heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as sensible as a dictionary!`,
`I declare it's marked out just like a large chessboard!`,
`There ought to be some men moving about somewhere and so there are!`,
`It's a great huge game of chess that's being played all over the world if this IS the world at all, you know`,
`Oh, what fun it is`,
`How I WISH I was one of them`,
`I wouldn't mind being a Pawn, if only I might join though of course I should LIKE to be a Queen, best.`,
`That's easily managed`,
`You can be the White Queen's Pawn, if you like, as Lily's too young to play`,
`and you're in the Second Square to begin with: when you get to the Eighth Square you'll be a Queen `,
`Faster`,
`Faster!`,
`I wonder if all the things move along with us?`,
`Faster`,
`Don't try to talk!`,
`Faster`,
`Faster!`,
`Are we nearly there?`,
`Nearly there!`,
`Why, we passed it ten minutes ago`,
`Faster!`,
`Now`,
`Now!`,
`Faster`,
`Faster!`,
`You may rest a little now.`,
`Why, I do believe we've been under this tree the whole time`,
`Everything's just as it was!`,
`Of course it is what would you have it?`,
`Well, in OUR country you'd generally get to somewhere else if you ran very fast for a long time, as we've been doing.`,
`A slow sort of country!`,
`Now, HERE, you see, it takes all the running YOU can do, to keep in the same place`,
`If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!`,
`I'd rather not try, please!`,
`I'm quite content to stay here only I AM so hot and thirsty!`,
`I know what YOU'd like!`,
`Have a biscuit?`,
`No While you're refreshing yourself I'll just take the measurements.`,
`At the end of two yards I shall give you your directions have another biscuit?`,
`No, thank you one's QUITE enough!`,
`Thirst quenched, I hope?`,
`At the end of THREE yards I shall repeat them for fear of your forgetting them`,
`At the end of FOUR, I shall say good bye`,
`And at the end of FIVE, I shall go!`,
`A pawn goes two squares in its first move, you know`,
`So you'll go VERY quickly through the Third Square by railway, I should think and you'll find yourself in the Fourth Square in no time`,
`Well, THAT square belongs to Tweedledum and Tweedledee the Fifth is mostly water the Sixth belongs to Humpty Dumpty But you make no remark?`,
`I I didn't know I had to make one just then You SHOULD have said, `,
`It's extremely kind of you to tell me all this`,
`however, we'll suppose it said the Seventh Square is all forest however, one of the Knights will show you the way and in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it's all feasting and fun!`,
`Speak in French when you can't think of the English for a thing turn out your toes as you walk and remember who you are!`,
`good bye and she CAN run very fast!`,
`It's something very like learning geography Principal rivers there ARE none`,
`Principal mountains I'm on the only one, but I don't think it's got any name`,
`Principal towns why, what ARE those creatures, making honey down there`,
`They can't be bees nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know `,
`just as if it was a regular bee And what enormous flowers they must be!`,
`Something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put to them and what quantities of honey they must make`,
`I think I'll go down and no, I won't JUST yet It'll never do to go down among them without a good long branch to brush them away and what fun it'll be when they ask me how I like my walk`,
`I shall say `,
`Oh, I like it well enough `,
``,
`only it was so dusty and hot, and the elephants did tease so!`,
`I think I'll go down the other way and perhaps I may visit the elephants later on`,
`Besides, I do so want to get into the Third Square!`,
`Tickets, please!`,
`Now then`,
`Show your ticket, child!`,
`like the chorus of a song Don't keep him waiting, child`,
`Why, his time is worth a thousand pounds a minute!`,
`I'm afraid I haven't got one there wasn't a ticket office where I came from.`,
`There wasn't room for one where she came from`,
`The land there is worth a thousand pounds an inch!`,
`Don't make excuses you should have bought one from the engine driver.`,
`The man that drives the engine`,
`Why, the smoke alone is worth a thousand pounds a puff!`,
`Then there's no use in speaking.`,
`Better say nothing at all`,
`Language is worth a thousand pounds a word!`,
`I shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, I know I shall!`,
`You're travelling the wrong way So young a child ought to know which way she's going, even if she doesn't know her own name!`,
`She ought to know her way to the ticket office, even if she doesn't know her alphabet!`,
`She'll have to go back from here as luggage!`,
`Change engines `,
`It sounds like a horse You might make a joke on that something about `,
`horse`,
`and `,
`hoarse,`,
`you know.`,
`She must be labelled `,
`Lass, with care,`,
`you know `,
`What a number of people there are in the carriage!`,
`She must go by post, as she's got a head on her `,
`She must be sent as a message by the telegraph `,
`She must draw the train herself the rest of the way `,
`Never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a return ticket every time the train stops.`,
`Indeed I shan't!`,
`I don't belong to this railway journey at all I was in a wood just now and I wish I could get back there.`,
`You might make a joke on THAT something about `,
`you WOULD if you could,`,
`you know.`,
`Don't tease so if you're so anxious to have a joke made, why don't you make one yourself?`,
`If it would only sigh like other people!`,
`I know you are a friend a dear friend, and an old friend`,
`And you won't hurt me, though I AM an insect.`,
`What kind of insect?`,
`What, then you don't `,
`It's only a brook we have to jump over.`,
`However, it'll take us into the Fourth Square, that's some comfort!`,
`about the size of a chicken then you don't like all insects?`,
`I like them when they can talk None of them ever talk, where _I_ come from.`,
`What sort of insects do you rejoice in, where YOU come from?`,
`I don't REJOICE in insects at all because I'm rather afraid of them at least the large kinds`,
`But I can tell you the names of some of them.`,
`Of course they answer to their names?`,
`I never knew them to do it.`,
`What's the use of their having names if they won't answer to them?`,
`No use to THEM but it's useful to the people who name them, I suppose`,
`If not, why do things have names at all?`,
`I can't say Further on, in the wood down there, they've got no names however, go on with your list of insects: you're wasting time.`,
`Well, there's the Horse fly All right half way up that bush, you'll see a Rocking horse fly, if you look`,
`It's made entirely of wood, and gets about by swinging itself from branch to branch.`,
`What does it live on?`,
`Sap and sawdust Go on with the list.`,
`And there's the Dragon fly.`,
`Look on the branch above your head and there you'll find a snap dragon fly`,
`Its body is made of plum pudding, its wings of holly leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.`,
`And what does it live on?`,
`Frumenty and mince pie and it makes its nest in a Christmas box.`,
`And then there's the Butterfly I wonder if that's the reason insects are so fond of flying into candles because they want to turn into Snap dragon flies!`,
`Crawling at your feet you may observe a Bread and Butterfly`,
`Its wings are thin slices of Bread and butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump of sugar.`,
`And what does IT live on?`,
`Weak tea with cream in it.`,
`Supposing it couldn't find any?`,
`Then it would die, of course.`,
`But that must happen very often It always happens I suppose you don't want to lose your name?`,
`No, indeed And yet I don't know only think how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it`,
`For instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she would call out `,
`come here ,`,
`and there she would have to leave off, because there wouldn't be any name for her to call, and of course you wouldn't have to go, you know.`,
`That would never do, I'm sure the governess would never think of excusing me lessons for that`,
`If she couldn't remember my name, she'd call me `,
`Miss!`,
`as the servants do.`,
`Well, if she said `,
`Miss,`,
`and didn't say anything more of course you'd miss your lessons`,
`That's a joke`,
`I wish YOU had made it.`,
`Why do you wish _I_ had made it?`,
`It's a very bad one.`,
`You shouldn't make jokes if it makes you so unhappy.`,
`for I certainly won't go BACK This must be the wood where things have no names`,
`I wonder what'll become of MY name when I go in`,
`I shouldn't like to lose it at all because they'd have to give me another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one`,
`But then the fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old name`,
`That's just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose dogs `,
`ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF DASH:`,
`Well, at any rate it's a great comfort after being so hot, to get into the into WHAT?`,
`I mean to get under the under the under THIS, you know!`,
`What DOES it call itself, I wonder`,
`I do believe it's got no name why, to be sure it hasn't!`,
`Then it really HAS happened, after all`,
`And now, who am I`,
`I WILL remember, if I can`,
`I'm determined to do it!`,
`L, I KNOW it begins with L!`,
`Here then`,
`Here then!`,
`What do you call yourself?`,
`I wish I knew!`,
`Nothing, just now.`,
`Think again that won't do.`,
`Please, would you tell me what YOU call yourself?`,
`I think that might help a little.`,
`I'll tell you, if you'll move a little further on I can't remember here.`,
`I'm a Fawn!`,
`and, dear me`,
`you're a human child!`,
`However, I know my name now.`,
`that's SOME comfort`,
`Alice Alice I won't forget it again`,
`And now, which of these finger posts ought I to follow, I wonder?`,
`I'll settle it when the road divides and they point different ways.`,
`TO TWEEDLEDUM's HOUSE`,
`TO THE HOUSE OF TWEEDLEDEE.`,
`I do believe that they live in the same house`,
`I wonder I never thought of that before But I can't stay there long`,
`I'll just call and say `,
`how d'you do?`,
`and ask them the way out of the wood`,
`If I could only get to the Eighth Square before it gets dark!`,
`DUM`,
`DEE.`,
`I suppose they've each got `,
`TWEEDLE`,
`round at the back of the collar DUM.`,
`If you think we're wax works you ought to pay, you know`,
`Wax works weren't made to be looked at for nothing, nohow!`,
`Contrariwise DEE if you think we're alive, you ought to speak.`,
`I'm sure I'm very sorry Tweedledum and Tweedledee Agreed to have a battle`,
`For Tweedledum said Tweedledee Had spoiled his nice new rattle`,
`Just then flew down a monstrous crow, As black as a tar barrel`,
`Which frightened both the heroes so, They quite forgot their quarrel.`,
`I know what you're thinking about but it isn't so, nohow.`,
`Contrariwise if it was so, it might be`,
`and if it were so, it would be`,
`but as it isn't, it ain't`,
`That's logic.`,
`I was thinking which is the best way out of this wood: it's getting so dark`,
`Would you tell me, please?`,
`First Boy!`,
`Nohow!`,
`Next Boy!`,
`Contrariwise!`,
`You've been wrong!`,
`The first thing in a visit is to say `,
`How d'ye do?`,
`and shake hands!`,
`But it certainly WAS funny to find myself singing `,
`HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH.`,
`I don't know when I began it, but somehow I felt as if I'd been singing it a long long time!`,
`Four times round is enough for one dance It would never do to say `,
`How d'ye do?`,
`NOW we seem to have got beyond that, somehow!`,
`I hope you're not much tired?`,
`Nohow`,
`And thank you VERY much for asking So much obliged!`,
`You like poetry?`,
`Ye es, pretty well SOME poetry Would you tell me which road leads out of the wood?`,
`What shall I repeat to her?`,
`THE WALRUS AND THE CARPENTER`,
`is the longest The sun was shining `,
`If it's VERY long would you please tell me first which road `,
`The sun was shining on the sea, Shining with all his might: He did his very best to make The billows smooth and bright And this was odd, because it was The middle of the night`,
`The moon was shining sulkily, Because she thought the sun Had got no business to be there After the day was done `,
`It's very rude of him,`,
`she said, `,
`To come and spoil the fun!`,
`The sea was wet as wet could be, The sands were dry as dry`,
`You could not see a cloud, because No cloud was in the sky: No birds were flying over head There were no birds to fly`,
`The Walrus and the Carpenter Were walking close at hand`,
`They wept like anything to see Such quantities of sand: `,
`If this were only cleared away,`,
`They said, `,
`it WOULD be grand!`,
``,
`If seven maids with seven mops Swept it for half a year, Do you suppose,`,
`the Walrus said, `,
`That they could get it clear?`,
``,
`I doubt it,`,
`said the Carpenter, And shed a bitter tear`,
``,
`O Oysters, come and walk with us!`,
`The Walrus did beseech`,
``,
`A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, Along the briny beach: We cannot do with more than four, To give a hand to each.`,
`The eldest Oyster looked at him`,
`But never a word he said: The eldest Oyster winked his eye, And shook his heavy head Meaning to say he did not choose To leave the oyster bed`,
`But four young oysters hurried up, All eager for the treat: Their coats were brushed, their faces washed, Their shoes were clean and neat And this was odd, because, you know, They hadn't any feet`,
`Four other Oysters followed them, And yet another four`,
`And thick and fast they came at last, And more, and more, and more All hopping through the frothy waves, And scrambling to the shore`,
`The Walrus and the Carpenter Walked on a mile or so, And then they rested on a rock Conveniently low: And all the little Oysters stood And waited in a row`,
``,
`The time has come,`,
`the Walrus said, `,
`To talk of many things: Of shoes and ships and sealing wax Of cabbages and kings And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings.`,
``,
`But wait a bit,`,
`the Oysters cried, `,
`Before we have our chat`,
`For some of us are out of breath, And all of us are fat!`,
``,
`No hurry!`,
`said the Carpenter`,
`They thanked him much for that`,
``,
`A loaf of bread,`,
`the Walrus said, `,
`Is what we chiefly need: Pepper and vinegar besides Are very good indeed Now if you're ready Oysters dear, We can begin to feed.`,
``,
`But not on us!`,
`the Oysters cried, Turning a little blue, `,
`After such kindness, that would be A dismal thing to do!`,
``,
`The night is fine,`,
`the Walrus said `,
`Do you admire the view`,
``,
`It was so kind of you to come`,
`And you are very nice!`,
`The Carpenter said nothing but `,
`Cut us another slice: I wish you were not quite so deaf I've had to ask you twice!`,
``,
`It seems a shame,`,
`the Walrus said, `,
`To play them such a trick, After we've brought them out so far, And made them trot so quick!`,
`The Carpenter said nothing but `,
`The butter's spread too thick!`,
``,
`I weep for you,`,
`the Walrus said`,
``,
`I deeply sympathize.`,
`With sobs and tears he sorted out Those of the largest size`,
`Holding his pocket handkerchief Before his streaming eyes`,
``,
`O Oysters,`,
`said the Carpenter`,
``,
`You've had a pleasant run`,
`Shall we be trotting home again?`,
`But answer came there none And that was scarcely odd, because They'd eaten every one.`,
`I like the Walrus best because you see he was a LITTLE sorry for the poor oysters.`,
`He ate more than the Carpenter, though You see he held his handkerchief in front, so that the Carpenter couldn't count how many he took: contrariwise.`,
`That was mean!`,
`Then I like the Carpenter best if he didn't eat so many as the Walrus.`,
`But he ate as many as he could get Well`,
`They were BOTH very unpleasant characters `,
`Are there any lions or tigers about here?`,
`It's only the Red King snoring Come and look at him!`,
`Isn't he a LOVELY sight?`,
`fit to snore his head off!`,
`I'm afraid he'll catch cold with lying on the damp grass He's dreaming now and what do you think he's dreaming about?`,
`Nobody can guess that.`,
`Why, about YOU!`,
`And if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose you'd be?`,
`Where I am now, of course Not you!`,
`You'd be nowhere`,
`Why, you're only a sort of thing in his dream!`,
`If that there King was to wake you'd go out bang`,
`just like a candle!`,
`I shouldn't!`,
`Besides, if I'm only a sort of thing in his dream, what are YOU, I should like to know?`,
`Ditto`,
`Ditto, ditto`,
`Hush`,
`You'll be waking him, I'm afraid, if you make so much noise.`,
`Well, it no use YOUR talking about waking him when you're only one of the things in his dream`,
`You know very well you're not real.`,
`I AM real!`,
`You won't make yourself a bit realler by crying there's nothing to cry about.`,
`If I wasn't real I shouldn't be able to cry.`,
`I hope you don't suppose those are real tears?`,
`I know they're talking nonsense and it's foolish to cry about it.`,
`At any rate I'd better be getting out of the wood, for really it's coming on very dark`,
`Do you think it's going to rain?`,
`No, I don't think it is at least not under HERE`,
`Nohow.`,
`But it may rain OUTSIDE?`,
`It may if it chooses we've no objection`,
`Contrariwise.`,
`Selfish things!`,
`Good night`,
`Do you see THAT?`,
`It's only a rattle Not a rattleSNAKE, you know only an old rattle quite old and broken.`,
`I knew it was!`,
`It's spoilt, of course!`,
`You needn't be so angry about an old rattle.`,
`But it isn't old!`,
`It's new, I tell you I bought it yesterday my nice new RATTLE!`,
`looking more like a fish than anything else Of course you agree to have a battle?`,
`I suppose so only SHE must help us to dress up, you know.`,
`I hope you're a good hand at pinning and tying strings?`,
`Every one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other.`,
`Really they'll be more like bundles of old clothes than anything else, by the time they're ready!`,
`to keep his head from being cut off You know it's one of the most serious things that can possibly happen to one in a battle to get one's head cut off.`,
`Do I look very pale?`,
`Well yes a LITTLE I'm very brave generally only to day I happen to have a headache.`,
`And I'vE got a toothache!`,
`I'm far worse off than you!`,
`Then you'd better not fight to day We MUST have a bit of a fight, but I don't care about going on long What's the time now?`,
`Half past four.`,
`Let's fight till six, and then have dinner Very well and SHE can watch us only you'd better not come VERY close I generally hit everything I can see when I get really excited.`,
`And _I_ hit everything within reach whether I can see it or not!`,
`You must hit the TREES pretty often, I should think I don't suppose there'll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by the time we've finished!`,
`And all about a rattle!`,
`I shouldn't have minded it so much if it hadn't been a new one.`,
`I wish the monstrous crow would come!`,
`There's only one sword, you know but you can have the umbrella it's quite as sharp`,
`Only we must begin quick`,
`It's getting as dark as it can.`,
`And darker What a thick black cloud that is!`,
`And how fast it comes`,
`Why, I do believe it's got wings!`,
`It's the crow!`,
`It can never get at me HERE it's far too large to squeeze itself in among the trees`,
`But I wish it wouldn't flap its wings so it makes quite a hurricane in the wood here's somebody's shawl being blown away!`,
`I'm very glad I happened to be in the way bread and butter, bread and butter Am I addressing the White Queen?`,
`Well, yes, if you call that a dressing It isn't MY notion of the thing, at all.`,
`If your Majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, I'll do it as well as I can.`,
`But I don't want it done at all!`,
`I've been a dressing myself for the last two hours.`,
`Every single thing's crooked and she's all over pins`,
`may I put your shawl straight for you?`,
`I don't know what's the matter with it!`,
`It's out of temper, I think`,
`I've pinned it here, and I've pinned it there, but there's no pleasing it!`,
`It CAN't go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one side and, dear me, what a state your hair is in!`,
`The brush has got entangled in it!`,
`And I lost the comb yesterday.`,
`Come, you look rather better now!`,
`But really you should have a lady's maid!`,
`I'm sure I'll take you with pleasure!`,
`Twopence a week, and jam every other day.`,
`I don't want you to hire ME and I don't care for jam.`,
`It's very good jam Well, I don't want any TO DAY, at any rate.`,
`You couldn't have it if you DID want it The rule is, jam to morrow and jam yesterday but never jam to day.`,
`It MUST come sometimes to `,
`jam to day,`,
`No, it can't It's jam every OTHER day: to day isn't any OTHER day, you know.`,
`I don't understand you It's dreadfully confusing!`,
`That's the effect of living backwards it always makes one a little giddy at first `,
`Living backwards!`,
`I never heard of such a thing!`,
`but there's one great advantage in it, that one's memory works both ways.`,
`I'm sure MINE only works one way I can't remember things before they happen.`,
`It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards What sort of things do YOU remember best?`,
`Oh, things that happened the week after next For instance, now there's the King's Messenger`,
`He's in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesn't even begin till next Wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of all.`,
`Suppose he never commits the crime?`,
`That would be all the better, wouldn't it?`,
`Of course it would be all the better but it wouldn't be all the better his being punished.`,
`You're wrong THERE, at any rate were YOU ever punished?`,
`Only for faults And you were all the better for it, I know!`,
`Yes, but then I HAD done the things I was punished for that makes all the difference.`,
`But if you HADN't done them that would have been better still`,
`better, and better, and better!`,
`better There's a mistake somewhere Oh, oh, oh!`,
`My finger's bleeding`,
`Oh, oh, oh, oh!`,
`What IS the matter?`,
`Have you pricked your finger?`,
`I haven't pricked it YET but I soon shall oh, oh, oh!`,
`When do you expect to do it?`,
`When I fasten my shawl again the brooch will come undone directly`,
`Oh, oh!`,
`Take care!`,
`You're holding it all crooked!`,
`That accounts for the bleeding, you see Now you understand the way things happen here.`,
`But why don't you scream now?`,
`Why, I've done all the screaming already What would be the good of having it all over again?`,
`The crow must have flown away, I think I'm so glad it's gone`,
`I thought it was the night coming on.`,
`I wish _I_ could manage to be glad!`,
`Only I never can remember the rule`,
`You must be very happy, living in this wood, and being glad whenever you like!`,
`Only it is so VERY lonely here!`,
`Oh, don't go on like that!`,
`Consider what a great girl you are`,
`Consider what a long way you've come to day`,
`Consider what o'clock it is`,
`Consider anything, only don't cry!`,
`Can YOU keep from crying by considering things?`,
`That's the way it's done nobody can do two things at once, you know`,
`Let's consider your age to begin with how old are you?`,
`I'm seven and a half exactly.`,
`You needn't say `,
`exactually,`,
`I can believe it without that`,
`Now I'll give YOU something to believe`,
`I'm just one hundred and one, five months and a day.`,
`I can't believe THAT!`,
`Can't you?`,
`Try again: draw a long breath, and shut your eyes.`,
`There's no use trying one CAN't believe impossible things.`,
`I daresay you haven't had much practice When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day`,
`Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast`,
`There goes the shawl again!`,
`I've got it!`,
`Now you shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!`,
`Then I hope your finger is better now?`,
`Oh, much better!`,
`Much be etter`,
`Be etter`,
`Be e e etter`,
`Be e ehh!`,
`What is it you want to buy?`,
`I don't QUITE know yet I should like to look all round me first, if I might.`,
`You may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like but you can't look ALL round you unless you've got eyes at the back of your head.`,
`Things flow about so here!`,
`And this one is the most provoking of all but I'll tell you what `,
`I'll follow it up to the very top shelf of all`,
`It'll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect!`,
`thing`,
`Are you a child or a teetotum?`,
`You'll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round like that.`,
`How CAN she knit with so many?`,
`She gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!`,
`Can you row?`,
`Yes, a little but not on land and not with needles `,
`Feather!`,
`Feather`,
`Feather!`,
`You'll be catching a crab directly.`,
`A dear little crab!`,
`I should like that.`,
`Didn't you hear me say `,
`Feather`,
`?`,
`Indeed I did you've said it very often and very loud`,
`Please, where ARE the crabs?`,
`In the water, of course!`,
`Feather, I say!`,
`WHY do you say `,
`feather`,
`so often?`,
`I'm not a bird!`,
`You are you're a little goose.`,
`Oh, please`,
`There are some scented rushes!`,
`There really are and SUCH beauties!`,
`You needn't say `,
`please`,
`to ME about em I didn't put em there, and I'm not going to take em away.`,
`No, but I meant please, may we wait and pick some?`,
`If you don't mind stopping the boat for a minute.`,
`How am _I_ to stop it?`,
`If you leave off rowing, it'll stop of itself.`,
`I only hope the boat won't tipple over!`,
`Oh, WHAT a lovely one`,
`Only I couldn't quite reach it.`,
`And it certainly DID seem a little provoking (almost as if it happened on purpose The prettiest are always further!`,
`Oh, oh, oh!`,
`That was a nice crab you caught!`,
`Was it`,
`I didn't see it I wish it hadn't let go I should so like to see a little crab to take home with me!`,
`Are there many crabs here?`,
`Crabs, and all sorts of things plenty of choice, only make up your mind`,
`Now, what DO you want to buy?`,
`To buy!`,
`I should like to buy an egg, please How do you sell them?`,
`Fivepence farthing for one Twopence for two Then two are cheaper than one?`,
`Only you MUST eat them both, if you buy two Then I'll have ONE, please They mightn't be at all nice, you know.`,
`I never put things into people's hands that would never do you must get it for yourself.`,
`I wonder WHY it wouldn't do?`,
`The egg seems to get further away the more I walk towards it`,
`Let me see, is this a chair`,
`Why, it's got branches, I declare`,
`How very odd to find trees growing here`,
`And actually here's a little brook`,
`Well, this is the very queerest shop I ever saw!`,
`It can't be anybody else!`,
`I'm as certain of it, as if his name were written all over his face.`,
`And how exactly like an egg he is!`,
`It's VERY provoking to be called an egg VERY!`,
`I said you LOOKED like an egg, Sir And some eggs are very pretty, you know`,
`Some people have no more sense than a baby!`,
`Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall: Humpty Dumpty had a great fall`,
`All the King's horses and all the King's men Couldn't put Humpty Dumpty in his place again.`,
`That last line is much too long for the poetry Don't stand there chattering to yourself like that but tell me your name and your business.`,
`My NAME is Alice, but `,
`It's a stupid enough name!`,
`What does it mean?`,
`MUST a name mean something?`,
`Of course it must MY name means the shape I am and a good handsome shape it is, too`,
`With a name like yours, you might be any shape, almost.`,
`Why do you sit out here all alone?`,
`Why, because there's nobody with me!`,
`Did you think I didn't know the answer to THAT`,
`Ask another.`,
`Don't you think you'd be safer down on the ground?`,
`That wall is so VERY narrow!`,
`What tremendously easy riddles you ask!`,
`Of course I don't think so`,
`Why, if ever I DID fall off which there's no chance of but IF I did `,
`IF I did fall THE KING HAS PROMISED ME ah, you may turn pale, if you like`,
`You didn't think I was going to say that, did you`,
`THE KING HAS PROMISED ME WITH HIS VERY OWN MOUTH to to `,
`To send all his horses and all his men Now I declare that's too bad!`,
`You've been listening at doors and behind trees and down chimneys or you couldn't have known it!`,
`I haven't, indeed!`,
`It's in a book.`,
`Ah, well`,
`They may write such things in a BOOK That's what you call a History of England, that is`,
`Now, take a good look at me`,
`I'm one that has spoken to a King, _I_ am: mayhap you'll never see such another: and to show you I'm not proud, you may shake hands with me!`,
`If he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet behind and then I don't know what would happen to his head`,
`I'm afraid it would come off!`,
`Yes, all his horses and all his men They'd pick me up again in a minute, THEY would`,
`However, this conversation is going on a little too fast: let's go back to the last remark but one.`,
`I'm afraid I can't quite remember it In that case we start fresh and it's my turn to choose a subject `,
`He talks about it just as if it was a game!`,
`So here's a question for you`,
`How old did you say you were?`,
`Seven years and six months.`,
`Wrong!`,
`You never said a word like it!`,
`I though you meant `,
`How old ARE you?`,
`If I'd meant that, I'd have said it Seven years and six months!`,
`An uncomfortable sort of age`,
`Now if you'd asked MY advice, I'd have said `,
`Leave off at seven`,
`but it's too late now.`,
`I never ask advice about growing Too proud?`,
`I mean that one can't help growing older.`,
`ONE can't, perhaps but TWO can`,
`With proper assistance, you might have left off at seven.`,
`What a beautiful belt you've got on!`,
`At least a beautiful cravat, I should have said no, a belt, I mean I beg your pardon!`,
`If I only knew which was neck and which was waist!`,
`It is a MOST PROVOKING thing when a person doesn't know a cravat from a belt!`,
`I know it's very ignorant of me It's a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say`,
`It's a present from the White King and Queen`,
`There now!`,
`Is it really?`,
`They gave it me they gave it me for an un birthday present.`,
`I beg your pardon?`,
`I'm not offended I mean, what IS an un birthday present?`,
`A present given when it isn't your birthday, of course.`,
`I like birthday presents best You don't know what you're talking about!`,
`How many days are there in a year?`,
`Three hundred and sixty five And how many birthdays have you?`,
`One.`,
`And if you take one from three hundred and sixty five, what remains?`,
`Three hundred and sixty four, of course.`,
`I'd rather see that done on paper That seems to be done right `,
`You're holding it upside down!`,
`To be sure I was!`,
`I thought it looked a little queer`,
`As I was saying, that SEEMS to be done right though I haven't time to look it over thoroughly just now and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty four days when you might get un birthday presents `,
`Certainly And only ONE for birthday presents, you know`,
`There's glory for you!`,
`I don't know what you mean by `,
`glory,`,
`Of course you don't till I tell you`,
`I meant `,
`there's a nice knock down argument for you!`,
`But `,
`glory`,
`doesn't mean `,
`a nice knock down argument,`,
`When _I_ use a word it means just what I choose it to mean neither more nor less.`,
`The question is whether you CAN make words mean so many different things.`,
`The question is which is to be master that's all.`,
`They've a temper, some of them particularly verbs, they're the proudest adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs however, _I_ can manage the whole lot of them`,
`Impenetrability`,
`That's what _I_ say!`,
`Would you tell me, please what that means?`,
`Now you talk like a reasonable child I meant by `,
`impenetrability`,
`that we've had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.`,
`That's a great deal to make one word mean When I make a word do a lot of work like that I always pay it extra.`,
`Oh!`,
`Ah, you should see em come round me of a Saturday night for to get their wages, you know.`,
`You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called `,
`Jabberwocky`,
`?`,
`Let's hear it I can explain all the poems that were ever invented and a good many that haven't been invented just yet.`,
`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves Did gyre and gimble in the wabe`,
`All mimsy were the borogoves, And the mome raths outgrabe`,
`That's enough to begin with there are plenty of hard words there`,
`BRILLIG`,
`means four o'clock in the afternoon the time when you begin BROILING things for dinner.`,
`That'll do very well and `,
`SLITHY`,
`?`,
`Well, `,
`SLITHY`,
`means `,
`lithe and slimy.`,
``,
`Lithe`,
`is the same as `,
`active.`,
`You see it's like a portmanteau there are two meanings packed up into one word.`,
`I see it now and what are `,
`TOVES`,
`?`,
`Well, `,
`TOVES`,
`are something like badgers they're something like lizards and they're something like corkscrews.`,
`They must be very curious looking creatures.`,
`They are that also they make their nests under sun dials also they live on cheese.`,
`And what's the `,
`GYRE`,
`and to `,
`GIMBLE`,
`?`,
`To `,
`GYRE`,
`is to go round and round like a gyroscope`,
`To `,
`GIMBLE`,
`is to make holes like a gimlet.`,
`And `,
`THE WABE`,
`is the grass plot round a sun dial, I suppose?`,
`Of course it is`,
`It's called `,
`WABE,`,
`you know, because it goes a long way before it, and a long way behind it `,
`And a long way beyond it on each side Exactly so`,
`Well, then, `,
`MIMSY`,
`is `,
`flimsy and miserable`,
`(there's another portmanteau for you)`,
`And a `,
`BOROGOVE`,
`is a thin shabby looking bird with its feathers sticking out all round something like a live mop.`,
`And then `,
`MOME RATHS`,
`?`,
`I'm afraid I'm giving you a great deal of trouble.`,
`Well, a `,
`RATH`,
`is a sort of green pig: but `,
`MOME`,
`I'm not certain about`,
`I think it's short for `,
`from home`,
`meaning that they'd lost their way, you know.`,
`And what does `,
`OUTGRABE`,
`mean?`,
`Well, `,
`OUTGRABING`,
`is something between bellowing and whistling, with a kind of sneeze in the middle: however, you'll hear it done, maybe down in the wood yonder and when you've once heard it you'll be QUITE content`,
`Who's been repeating all that hard stuff to you?`,
`I read it in a book But I had some poetry repeated to me, much easier than that, by Tweedledee, I think it was.`,
`As to poetry, you know _I_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes to that `,
`Oh, it needn't come to that!`,
`The piece I'm going to repeat was written entirely for your amusement.`,
`Thank you`,
`In winter, when the fields are white, I sing this song for your delight only I don't sing it I see you don't If you can SEE whether I'm singing or not, you've sharper eyes than most.`,
`In spring, when woods are getting green, I'll try and tell you what I mean.`,
`Thank you very much In summer, when the days are long, Perhaps you'll understand the song: In autumn, when the leaves are brown, Take pen and ink, and write it down.`,
`I will, if I can remember it so long You needn't go on making remarks like that they're not sensible, and they put me out.`,
`I sent a message to the fish: I told them `,
`This is what I wish.`,
`The little fishes of the sea, They sent an answer back to me`,
`The little fishes`,
`I'm afraid I don't quite understand It gets easier further on I sent to them again to say `,
`It will be better to obey.`,
`The fishes answered with a grin, `,
`Why, what a temper you are in!`,
`I told them once, I told them twice: They would not listen to advice`,
`I took a kettle large and new, Fit for the deed I had to do`,
`My heart went hop, my heart went thump`,
`I filled the kettle at the pump`,
`Then some one came to me and said, `,
`The little fishes are in bed.`,
`I said to him, I said it plain, `,
`Then you must wake them up again.`,
`I said it very loud and clear`,
`I went and shouted in his ear.`,
`I wouldn't have been the messenger for ANYTHING!`,
`But he was very stiff and proud`,
`He said `,
`You needn't shout so loud!`,
`And he was very proud and stiff`,
`He said `,
`I'd go and wake them, if `,
`I took a corkscrew from the shelf: I went to wake them up myself`,
`And when I found the door was locked, I pulled and pushed and kicked and knocked`,
`And when I found the door was shut, I tried to turn the handle, but `,
`Is that all?`,
`That's all Good bye.`,
`Good bye, till we meet again!`,
`I shouldn't know you again if we DID meet you're so exactly like other people.`,
`The face is what one goes by, generally That's just what I complain of Your face is the same as everybody has the two eyes, so `,
`nose in the middle, mouth under`,
`It's always the same`,
`Now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for instance or the mouth at the top that would be SOME help.`,
`It wouldn't look nice Wait till you've tried.`,
`Good bye!`,
`Of all the unsatisfactory `,
`of all the unsatisfactory people I EVER met `,
`I've sent them all!`,
`Did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came through the wood?`,
`Yes, I did several thousand, I should think.`,
`Four thousand two hundred and seven, that's the exact number I couldn't send all the horses, you know, because two of them are wanted in the game`,
`And I haven't sent the two Messengers, either`,
`They're both gone to the town`,
`Just look along the road, and tell me if you can see either of them.`,
`I see nobody on the road I only wish _I_ had such eyes To be able to see Nobody`,
`And at that distance, too`,
`Why, it's as much as _I_ can do to see real people, by this light!`,
`I see somebody now!`,
`But he's coming very slowly and what curious attitudes he goes into!`,
`Not at all He's an Anglo Saxon Messenger and those are Anglo Saxon attitudes`,
`He only does them when he's happy`,
`His name is Haigha.`,
`mayor.`,
`I love my love with an H because he is Happy`,
`I hate him with an H, because he is Hideous`,
`I fed him with with with Ham sandwiches and Hay`,
`His name is Haigha, and he lives `,
`He lives on the Hill The other Messenger's called Hatta`,
`I must have TWO, you know to come and go`,
`One to come, and one to go.`,
`I beg your pardon?`,
`It isn't respectable to beg I only meant that I didn't understand Why one to come and one to go?`,
`Didn't I tell you?`,
`I must have Two to fetch and carry`,
`One to fetch, and one to carry.`,
`This young lady loves you with an H You alarm me!`,
`I feel faint Give me a ham sandwich!`,
`Another sandwich!`,
`There's nothing but hay left now Hay, then There's nothing like eating hay when you're faint I should think throwing cold water over you would be better or some sal volatile.`,
`I didn't say there was nothing BETTER I said there was nothing LIKE it.`,
`Who did you pass on the road?`,
`Nobody Quite right this young lady saw him too`,
`So of course Nobody walks slower than you.`,
`I do my best I'm sure nobody walks much faster than I do!`,
`He can't do that or else he'd have been here first`,
`However, now you've got your breath, you may tell us what's happened in the town.`,
`I'll whisper it They're at it again!`,
`Do you call THAT a whisper?`,
`If you do such a thing again, I'll have you buttered`,
`It went through and through my head like an earthquake!`,
`It would have to be a very tiny earthquake!`,
`Who are at it again?`,
`Why the Lion and the Unicorn, of course Fighting for the crown?`,
`Yes, to be sure and the best of the joke is, that it's MY crown all the while`,
`Let's run and see them.`,
`The Lion and the Unicorn were fighting for the crown: The Lion beat the Unicorn all round the town`,
`Some gave them white bread, some gave them brown`,
`Some gave them plum cake and drummed them out of town.`,
`Does the one that wins get the crown?`,
`Dear me, no!`,
`What an idea!`,
`Would you be good enough to stop a minute just to get one's breath again?`,
`I'm GOOD enough only I'm not strong enough`,
`You see, a minute goes by so fearfully quick`,
`You might as well try to stop a Bandersnatch!`,
`He's only just out of prison, and he hadn't finished his tea when he was sent in and they only give them oyster shells in there so you see he's very hungry and thirsty`,
`How are you, dear child?`,
`Were you happy in prison, dear child?`,
`Speak, can't you!`,
`Speak, won't you!`,
`How are they getting on with the fight?`,
`They're getting on very well each of them has been down about eighty seven times.`,
`Then I suppose they'll soon bring the white bread and the brown?`,
`It's waiting for em now this is a bit of it as I'm eating.`,
`Ten minutes allowed for refreshments!`,
`I don't think they'll fight any more to day go and order the drums to begin.`,
`Look, look!`,
`There's the White Queen running across the country`,
`She came flying out of the wood over yonder How fast those Queens CAN run!`,
`There's some enemy after her, no doubt That wood's full of them.`,
`But aren't you going to run and help her?`,
`No use, no use!`,
`She runs so fearfully quick`,
`You might as well try to catch a Bandersnatch`,
`But I'll make a memorandum about her, if you like She's a dear good creature Do you spell `,
`creature`,
`with a double `,
`e`,
`?`,
`I had the best of it this time?`,
`A little a little You shouldn't have run him through with your horn, you know.`,
`It didn't hurt him What is this?`,
`This is a child!`,
`We only found it to day`,
`It's as large as life, and twice as natural!`,
`I always thought they were fabulous monsters!`,
`Is it alive?`,
`It can talk Talk, child.`,
`Do you know, I always thought Unicorns were fabulous monsters, too`,
`I never saw one alive before!`,
`Well, now that we HAVE seen each other if you'll believe in me, I'll believe in you`,
`Is that a bargain?`,
`Yes, if you like Come, fetch out the plum cake, old man!`,
`None of your brown bread for me!`,
`Certainly certainly!`,
`Open the bag!`,
`Quick`,
`Not that one that's full of hay!`,
`What's this!`,
`Ah, what IS it, now?`,
`You'll never guess`,
`_I_ couldn't.`,
`Are you animal vegetable or mineral?`,
`It's a fabulous monster!`,
`Then hand round the plum cake, Monster And sit down, both of you fair play with the cake, you know!`,
`What a fight we might have for the crown, NOW!`,
`I should win easy I'm not so sure of that Why, I beat you all round the town, you chicken!`,
`All round the town?`,
`That's a good long way`,
`Did you go by the old bridge, or the market place`,
`You get the best view by the old bridge.`,
`I'm sure I don't know There was too much dust to see anything`,
`What a time the Monster is, cutting up that cake!`,
`It's very provoking!`,
`the Monster`,
`I've cut several slices already, but they always join on again!`,
`You don't know how to manage Looking glass cakes Hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.`,
`NOW cut it up I say, this isn't fair!`,
`The Monster has given the Lion twice as much as me!`,
`She's kept none for herself, anyhow Do you like plum cake, Monster?`,
`If THAT doesn't `,
`drum them out of town,`,
`nothing ever will!`,
`It's my own Invention`,
`So I wasn't dreaming, after all unless unless we're all part of the same dream`,
`Only I do hope it's MY dream, and not the Red King's`,
`I don't like belonging to another person's dream I've a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens!`,
`Ahoy`,
`Ahoy`,
`Check!`,
`You're my prisoner!`,
`You're my `,
`Ahoy`,
`Ahoy`,
`Check!`,
`She's MY prisoner, you know!`,
`Yes, but then _I_ came and rescued her!`,
`Well, we must fight for her, then You will observe the Rules of Battle, of course?`,
`I always do I wonder, now, what the Rules of Battle are one Rule seems to be, that if one Knight hits the other, he knocks him off his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself and another Rule seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were Punch and Judy What a noise they make when they tumble`,
`Just like a whole set of fire irons falling into the fender`,
`And how quiet the horses are`,
`They let them get on and off them just as if they were tables!`,
`It was a glorious victory, wasn't it?`,
`I don't know I don't want to be anybody's prisoner`,
`I want to be a Queen.`,
`So you will, when you've crossed the next brook I'll see you safe to the end of the wood and then I must go back, you know`,
`That's the end of my move.`,
`Thank you very much May I help you off with your helmet?`,
`Now one can breathe more easily I see you're admiring my little box.`,
`It's my own invention to keep clothes and sandwiches in`,
`You see I carry it upside down, so that the rain can't get in.`,
`But the things can get OUT Do you know the lid's open?`,
`I didn't know it Then all the things must have fallen out`,
`And the box is no use without them.`,
`Can you guess why I did that?`,
`In hopes some bees may make a nest in it then I should get the honey.`,
`But you've got a bee hive or something like one fastened to the saddle Yes, it's a very good bee hive one of the best kind`,
`But not a single bee has come near it yet`,
`And the other thing is a mouse trap`,
`I suppose the mice keep the bees out or the bees keep the mice out, I don't know which.`,
`I was wondering what the mouse trap was for It isn't very likely there would be any mice on the horse's back.`,
`Not very likely, perhaps but if they DO come, I don't choose to have them running all about.`,
`You see it's as well to be provided for EVERYTHING`,
`That's the reason the horse has all those anklets round his feet.`,
`But what are they for?`,
`To guard against the bites of sharks It's an invention of my own`,
`And now help me on`,
`I'll go with you to the end of the wood What's the dish for?`,
`It's meant for plum cake We'd better take it with us It'll come in handy if we find any plum cake`,
`Help me to get it into this bag.`,
`It's rather a tight fit, you see There are so many candlesticks in the bag.`,
`I hope you've got your hair well fastened on?`,
`Only in the usual way That's hardly enough You see the wind is so VERY strong here`,
`It's as strong as soup.`,
`Have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?`,
`Not yet But I've got a plan for keeping it from FALLING off.`,
`I should like to hear it, very much.`,
`First you take an upright stick Then you make your hair creep up it, like a fruit tree`,
`Now the reason hair falls off is because it hangs DOWN things never fall UPWARDS, you know`,
`It's a plan of my own invention`,
`You may try it if you like.`,
`I'm afraid you've not had much practice in riding What makes you say that?`,
`Because people don't fall off quite so often, when they've had much practice.`,
`I've had plenty of practice plenty of practice!`,
`Indeed?`,
`The great art of riding is to keep `,
`I hope no bones are broken?`,
`None to speak of The great art of riding, as I was saying, is to keep your balance properly`,
`Like this, you know `,
`Plenty of practice!`,
`Plenty of practice!`,
`It's too ridiculous!`,
`You ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought!`,
`Does that kind go smoothly?`,
`Much more smoothly than a live horse I'll get one One or two several.`,
`I'm a great hand at inventing things`,
`Now, I daresay you noticed, that last time you picked me up, that I was looking rather thoughtful?`,
`You WERE a little grave Well, just then I was inventing a new way of getting over a gate would you like to hear it?`,
`Very much indeed I'll tell you how I came to think of it You see, I said to myself, `,
`The only difficulty is with the feet: the HEAD is high enough already.`,
`Now, first I put my head on the top of the gate then I stand on my head then the feet are high enough, you see then I'm over, you see.`,
`Yes, I suppose you'd be over when that was done but don't you think it would be rather hard?`,
`I haven't tried it yet so I can't tell for certain but I'm afraid it WOULD be a little hard.`,
`What a curious helmet you've got!`,
`Is that your invention too?`,
`Yes but I've invented a better one than that like a sugar loaf`,
`When I used to wear it, if I fell off the horse, it always touched the ground directly`,
`So I had a VERY little way to fall, you see But there WAS the danger of falling INTO it, to be sure`,
`That happened to me once and the worst of it was, before I could get out again, the other White Knight came and put it on`,
`He thought it was his own helmet.`,
`I'm afraid you must have hurt him being on the top of his head.`,
`I had to kick him, of course And then he took the helmet off again but it took hours and hours to get me out`,
`I was as fast as as lightning, you know.`,
`But that's a different kind of fastness It was all kinds of fastness with me, I can assure you!`,
`All kinds of fastness but it was careless of him to put another man's helmet on with the man in it, too.`,
`How CAN you go on talking so quietly, head downwards?`,
`What does it matter where my body happens to be?`,
`My mind goes on working all the same`,
`In fact, the more head downwards I am, the more I keep inventing new things.`,
`Now the cleverest thing of the sort that I ever did was inventing a new pudding during the meat course.`,
`In time to have it cooked for the next course?`,
`Well, not the NEXT course no, certainly not the next COURSE.`,
`Then it would have to be the next day`,
`I suppose you wouldn't have two pudding courses in one dinner?`,
`Well, not the NEXT day not the next DAY`,
`In fact I don't believe that pudding ever WAS cooked`,
`In fact, I don't believe that pudding ever WILL be cooked`,
`And yet it was a very clever pudding to invent.`,
`What did you mean it to be made of?`,
`It began with blotting paper That wouldn't be very nice, I'm afraid `,
`Not very nice ALONE but you've no idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things such as gunpowder and sealing wax`,
`And here I must leave you.`,
`You are sad let me sing you a song to comfort you.`,
`Is it very long?`,
`It's long but very, VERY beautiful`,
`Everybody that hears me sing it either it brings the TEARS into their eyes, or else `,
`Or else what?`,
`Or else it doesn't, you know`,
`The name of the song is called `,
`HADDOCKS`,
`Oh, that's the name of the song, is it?`,
`No, you don't understand That's what the name is CALLED`,
`The name really IS `,
`THE AGED AGED MAN.`,
`Then I ought to have said `,
`That's what the SONG is called`,
`?`,
`No, you oughtn't: that's quite another thing`,
`The SONG is called `,
`WAYS AND MEANS`,
`: but that's only what it's CALLED, you know!`,
`Well, what IS the song, then?`,
`I was coming to that The song really IS `,
`A SITTING ON A GATE`,
`: and the tune's my own invention.`,
`But the tune ISN't his own invention it's `,
`I GIVE THEE ALL, I CAN NO MORE.`,
`I'll tell thee everything I can`,
`There's little to relate`,
`I saw an aged aged man, A sitting on a gate`,
``,
`Who are you, aged man?`,
`I said, `,
`and how is it you live?`,
`And his answer trickled through my head Like water through a sieve`,
`He said `,
`I look for butterflies That sleep among the wheat: I make them into mutton pies, And sell them in the street`,
`I sell them unto men,`,
`he said, `,
`Who sail on stormy seas`,
`And that's the way I get my bread A trifle, if you please.`,
`But I was thinking of a plan To dye one's whiskers green, And always use so large a fan That they could not be seen`,
`So, having no reply to give To what the old man said, I cried, `,
`Come, tell me how you live!`,
`And thumped him on the head`,
`His accents mild took up the tale: He said `,
`I go my ways, And when I find a mountain rill, I set it in a blaze`,
`And thence they make a stuff they call Rolands`,
`You've only a few yards to go down the hill and over that little brook, and then you'll be a Queen But you'll stay and see me off first?`,
`I shan't be long`,
`You'll wait and wave your handkerchief when I get to that turn in the road`,
`I think it'll encourage me, you see.`,
`Of course I'll wait and thank you very much for coming so far and for the song I liked it very much.`,
`I hope so but you didn't cry so much as I thought you would.`,
`It won't take long to see him OFF, I expect There he goes`,
`Right on his head as usual`,
`However, he gets on again pretty easily that comes of having so many things hung round the horse `,
`I hope it encouraged him and now for the last brook, and to be a Queen`,
`How grand it sounds!`,
`The Eighth Square at last!`,
`Oh, how glad I am to get here`,
`And what IS this on my head?`,
`But how CAN it have got there without my knowing it?`,
`Well, this IS grand!`,
`I never expected I should be a Queen so soon and I'll tell you what it is, your majesty it'll never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that`,
`Queens have to be dignified, you know!`,
`and if I really am a Queen I shall be able to manage it quite well in time.`,
`Please, would you tell me `,
`Speak when you're spoken to!`,
`But if everybody obeyed that rule and if you only spoke when you were spoken to, and the other person always waited for YOU to begin, you see nobody would ever say anything, so that `,
`Ridiculous!`,
`Why, don't you see, child `,
`What do you mean by `,
`If you really are a Queen`,
`What right have you to call yourself so`,
`You can't be a Queen, you know, till you've passed the proper examination`,
`And the sooner we begin it, the better.`,
`I only said `,
`if`,
`!`,
`She SAYS she only said `,
`if`,
``,
`But she said a great deal more than that!`,
`Oh, ever so much more than that!`,
`So you did, you know Always speak the truth think before you speak and write it down afterwards.`,
`I'm sure I didn't mean `,
`That's just what I complain of`,
`You SHOULD have meant`,
`What do you suppose is the use of child without any meaning`,
`Even a joke should have some meaning and a child's more important than a joke, I hope`,
`You couldn't deny that, even if you tried with both hands.`,
`I don't deny things with my HANDS Nobody said you did I said you couldn't if you tried.`,
`She's in that state of mind that she wants to deny SOMETHING only she doesn't know what to deny!`,
`A nasty, vicious temper I invite you to Alice's dinner party this afternoon.`,
`And I invite YOU.`,
`I didn't know I was to have a party at all but if there is to be one, I think _I_ ought to invite the guests.`,
`We gave you the opportunity of doing it but I daresay you've not had many lessons in manners yet?`,
`Manners are not taught in lessons Lessons teach you to do sums, and things of that sort.`,
`And you do Addition?`,
`What's one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?`,
`I don't know I lost count.`,
`She can't do Addition Can you do Subtraction`,
`Take nine from eight.`,
`Nine from eight I can't, you know but `,
`She can't do Subtraction Can you do Division`,
`Divide a loaf by a knife what's the answer to that?`,
`I suppose `,
`Bread and butter, of course`,
`Try another Subtraction sum`,
`Take a bone from a dog: what remains?`,
`The bone wouldn't remain, of course, if I took it and the dog wouldn't remain`,
`it would come to bite me and I'm sure I shouldn't remain!`,
`Then you think nothing would remain?`,
`I think that's the answer.`,
`Wrong, as usual the dog's temper would remain.`,
`But I don't see how `,
`Why, look here!`,
`The dog would lose its temper, wouldn't it?`,
`Perhaps it would Then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!`,
`They might go different ways.`,
`What dreadful nonsense we ARE talking!`,
`She can't do sums a BIT!`,
`Can YOU do sums?`,
`I can do Addition, if you give me time but I can't do Subtraction, under ANY circumstances!`,
`Of course you know your A B C?`,
`To be sure I do.`,
`So do I we'll often say it over together, dear`,
`And I'll tell you a secret I can read words of one letter`,
`Isn't THAT grand`,
`However, don't be discouraged`,
`You'll come to it in time.`,
`Can you answer useful questions?`,
`How is bread made?`,
`I know THAT!`,
`You take some flour `,
`Where do you pick the flower?`,
`In a garden, or in the hedges?`,
`Well, it isn't PICKED at all it's GROUND `,
`How many acres of ground?`,
`You mustn't leave out so many things.`,
`Fan her head!`,
`She'll be feverish after so much thinking.`,
`She's all right again now Do you know Languages`,
`What's the French for fiddle de dee?`,
`Fiddle de dee's not English Who ever said it was?`,
`If you'll tell me what language `,
`fiddle de dee`,
`is, I'll tell you the French for it!`,
`Queens never make bargains.`,
`I wish Queens never asked questions Don't let us quarrel What is the cause of lightning?`,
`The cause of lightning is the thunder no, no!`,
`I meant the other way.`,
`It's too late to correct it when you've once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.`,
`Which reminds me `,
`we had SUCH a thunderstorm last Tuesday I mean one of the last set of Tuesdays, you know.`,
`In OUR country there's only one day at a time.`,
`That's a poor thin way of doing things`,
`Now HERE, we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes in the winter we take as many as five nights together for warmth, you know.`,
`Are five nights warmer than one night, then?`,
`Five times as warm, of course.`,
`But they should be five times as COLD, by the same rule `,
`Just so!`,
`Five times as warm, AND five times as cold just as I'm five times as rich as you are, AND five times as clever!`,
`It's exactly like a riddle with no answer!`,
`Humpty Dumpty saw it too He came to the door with a corkscrew in his hand `,
`What did he want?`,
`He said he WOULD come in because he was looking for a hippopotamus`,
`Now, as it happened, there wasn't such a thing in the house, that morning.`,
`Is there generally?`,
`Well, only on Thursdays I know what he came for he wanted to punish the fish, because `,
`It was SUCH a thunderstorm, you can't think!`,
`She NEVER could, you know And part of the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in and it went rolling round the room in great lumps and knocking over the tables and things till I was so frightened, I couldn't remember my own name!`,
`I never should TRY to remember my name in the middle of an accident`,
`Where would be the use of it?`,
`Your Majesty must excuse her she means well, but she can't help saying foolish things, as a general rule.`,
`She never was really well brought up but it's amazing how good tempered she is`,
`Pat her on the head, and see how pleased she'll be!`,
`A little kindness and putting her hair in papers would do wonders with her `,
`I AM so sleepy?`,
`She's tired, poor thing!`,
`Smooth her hair lend her your nightcap and sing her a soothing lullaby.`,
`I haven't got a nightcap with me and I don't know any soothing lullabies.`,
`I must do it myself, then Hush a by lady, in Alice's lap`,
`Till the feast's ready, we've time for a nap: When the feast's over, we'll go to the ball Red Queen, and White Queen, and Alice, and all`,
`And now you know the words just sing it through to ME`,
`I'm getting sleepy, too.`,
`What AM I to do?`,
`I don't think it EVER happened before, that any one had to take care of two Queens asleep at once`,
`No, not in all the History of England it couldn't, you know, because there never was more than one Queen at a time`,
`Do wake up, you heavy things!`,
`Visitors`,
`Servants`,
`I'll wait till the song's over and then I'll ring the WHICH bell must I ring?`,
`I'm not a visitor, and I'm not a servant`,
`There OUGHT to be one marked `,
`Queen,`,
`you know `,
`No admittance till the week after next!`,
`What is it, now?`,
`Where's the servant whose business it is to answer the door?`,
`Which door?`,
`THIS door, of course!`,
`To answer the door?`,
`What's it been asking of?`,
`I don't know what you mean I talks English, doesn't I?`,
`Or are you deaf`,
`What did it ask you?`,
`Nothing!`,
`I've been knocking at it!`,
`Shouldn't do that shouldn't do that `,
`Vexes it, you know.`,
`You let IT alone and it'll let YOU alone, you know.`,
`To the Looking Glass world it was Alice that said, `,
`I've a sceptre in hand, I've a crown on my head`,
`Let the Looking Glass creatures, whatever they be, Come and dine with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me.`,
`Then fill up the glasses as quick as you can, And sprinkle the table with buttons and bran: Put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea And welcome Queen Alice with thirty times three!`,
`Thirty times three makes ninety`,
`I wonder if any one's counting?`,
`O Looking Glass creatures,`,
`quoth Alice, `,
`draw near`,
`Tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear: Tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea Along with the Red Queen, the White Queen, and me!`,
`Then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink, Or anything else that is pleasant to drink: Mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine And welcome Queen Alice with ninety times nine!`,
`Ninety times nine!`,
`Oh, that'll never be done`,
`I'd better go in at once `,
`I'm glad they've come without waiting to be asked I should never have known who were the right people to invite!`,
`You've missed the soup and fish Put on the joint!`,
`You look a little shy`,
`let me introduce you to that leg of mutton Alice Mutton`,
`Mutton Alice.`,
`May I give you a slice?`,
`Certainly not it isn't etiquette to cut any one you've been introduced to`,
`Remove the joint!`,
`I won't be introduced to the pudding, please or we shall get no dinner at all`,
`May I give you some?`,
`Pudding Alice`,
`Alice Pudding`,
`Remove the pudding!`,
`Waiter`,
`Bring back the pudding!`,
`What impertinence!`,
`I wonder how you'd like it, if I were to cut a slice out of YOU, you creature!`,
`Make a remark it's ridiculous to leave all the conversation to the pudding!`,
`Do you know, I've had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to day and it's a very curious thing, I think every poem was about fishes in some way`,
`Do you know why they're so fond of fishes, all about here?`,
`As to fishes her White Majesty knows a lovely riddle all in poetry all about fishes`,
`Shall she repeat it?`,
`Her Red Majesty's very kind to mention it It would be SUCH a treat`,
`May I?`,
`Please do `,
`First, the fish must be caught.`,
`That is easy: a baby, I think, could have caught it`,
``,
`Next, the fish must be bought.`,
`That is easy: a penny, I think, would have bought it`,
``,
`Now cook me the fish!`,
`That is easy, and will not take more than a minute`,
``,
`Let it lie in a dish!`,
`That is easy, because it already is in it`,
``,
`Bring it here`,
`Let me sup!`,
`It is easy to set such a dish on the table`,
``,
`Take the dish cover up!`,
`Ah, THAT is so hard that I fear I'm unable`,
`For it holds it like glue Holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle: Which is easiest to do, Un dish cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?`,
`Take a minute to think about it, and then guess Meanwhile, we'll drink your health Queen Alice's health!`,
`just like pigs in a trough!`,
`You ought to return thanks in a neat speech We must support you, you know Thank you very much but I can do quite well without.`,
`That wouldn't be at all the thing And they DID push so!`,
`You would have thought they wanted to squeeze me flat!`,
`I rise to return thanks `,
`Take care of yourself!`,
`Something's going to happen!`,
`and very like birds they look Here I am!`,
`I can't stand this any longer!`,
`And as for YOU As for YOU I'll shake you into a kitten, that I will!`,
`Your majesty shouldn't purr so loud You woke me out of oh`,
`such a nice dream`,
`And you've been along with me, Kitty all through the Looking Glass world`,
`Did you know it, dear?`,
`If they would only purr for `,
`yes`,
`and mew for `,
`no,`,
`or any rule of that sort so that one could keep up a conversation`,
`But how CAN you talk with a person if they always say the same thing?`,
`yes`,
`no.`,
`Now, Kitty!`,
`Confess that was what you turned into!`,
`But it wouldn't look at it it turned away its head, and pretended not to see it: but it looked a LITTLE ashamed of itself, so I think it MUST have been the Red Queen.`,
`Sit up a little more stiffly, dear!`,
`And curtsey while you're thinking what to what to purr`,
`It saves time, remember!`,
`just in honour of having been a Red Queen.`,
`Snowdrop, my pet!`,
`when WILL Dinah have finished with your White Majesty, I wonder`,
`That must be the reason you were so untidy in my dream Dinah`,
`do you know that you're scrubbing a White Queen`,
`Really, it's most disrespectful of you`,
`And what did DINAH turn to, I wonder?`,
`Tell me, Dinah, did you turn to Humpty Dumpty`,
`I THINK you did however, you'd better not mention it to your friends just yet, for I'm not sure`,
`By the way, Kitty, if only you'd been really with me in my dream, there was one thing you WOULD have enjoyed I had such a quantity of poetry said to me, all about fishes`,
`To morrow morning you shall have a real treat`,
`All the time you're eating your breakfast, I'll repeat `,
`The Walrus and the Carpenter`,
`to you`,
`and then you can make believe it's oysters, dear`,
`Now, Kitty, let's consider who it was that dreamed it all`,
`This is a serious question, my dear, and you should NOT go on licking your paw like that as if Dinah hadn't washed you this morning`,
`You see, Kitty, it MUST have been either me or the Red King`,
